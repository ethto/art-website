    <p class="micro">This repackaging project includes a logo and a brand guideline. I’ve gone over proper colours, fonts, letterheads, layouts, alternate logos, spacing, logo treatment, what not to do, and much more. This brand guideline was a booklet with a strong layout that shows my type, layout, and print skills.</p>
