I imagine a life for myself full of excitement. I expect to uproot and change my lifestyle every few years; move to a new country, pick up new hobbies, and constantly recreate myself.

That's why I'm a designer. I'm building a career for myself based on  freedom, flexibility, and fun. I want to life a big life and make a difference while I'm here. My goal is to find solutions to the problems that affect people most. The world is moving forward; I want to contribute. I want to help.
