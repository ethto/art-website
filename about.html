    <p class="milli">I imagine a life for myself full of excitement. I expect to uproot and change my lifestyle every few years; move to a new country, pick up new hobbies, and constantly recreate myself.</p>
    <p class="milli">That's why I'm a designer. I'm building a career for myself based on  freedom, flexibility, and fun. I want to live a big life and make a difference while I'm here. My goal is to find solutions to the problems that affect people most. The world is moving forward; I want to contribute. I want to help. <strong>To get a better idea of who I am, here are some things I enjoy:</strong></p>

    <ul class="interests italic">
