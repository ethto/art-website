      <p class="milli">I'm a multidisciplinary designer focused on branding and print design, with a growing interest in motion. For me, it's all about the process. Concept is key and I can sketch until my hand falls off.</p>

      <p class="milli">I imagine a life for myself full of excitement. I expect to uproot and change my lifestyle every few years; pick up new hobbies, move to a new place, and constantly be recreating myself. That's why I'm a designer. I'm building a career for myself based on  freedom, flexibility, and fun. I want to live a big life and make a difference while I'm here. My goal is to find solutions to the problems that affect people most. The world is moving forward and I want to be a part of it.</p>
